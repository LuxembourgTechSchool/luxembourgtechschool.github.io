### Announcing the Launch of Our Updated Website

Welcome to our new website. We wanted to provide, you, the students, but also parents as well as interested partners and
industry in Luxembourg about our three year-long programs as well as about the wide variety of our other projects and
activities. Everything is easier to navigate, and more user-friendly.

The new website gives better access to How it Works, Programs Overview, Videos, Projects, our Team, Registrations and
includes a News section with featured highlights of our work. We have also added a section with Frequently Asked
Questions, so make sure to check everything out. If you still have questions simply get in touch with us, we are there
for you to give you more information.
