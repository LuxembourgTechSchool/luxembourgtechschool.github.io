LTS Level UP students discovered the fascinating and revolutionary world of Space Resources in the latest module of the school year.

During the weekly classes our Level UP students learned and applied many concepts: from the resources found on the moon and how these could be used to create a lunar base that would facilitate the study of lunar science and take longer space travel, to how to use and navigate with very powerful rovers, similar to those used in real space missions. 

The module ended with a very cool event at the LunaLab of the University of Luxembourg, where Miguel Olivares-Mendez and his team of the Interdisciplinary Space Master Program introduced us to their space and demonstrated their work with fully autonomous rovers. Afterwards, our students were able to test our own LTS rovers in the lunar yard.
