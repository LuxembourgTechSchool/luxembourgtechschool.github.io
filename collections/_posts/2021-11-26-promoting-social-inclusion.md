For our first international edition of a hackathon, we brought together, alongside our main financial education sponsor Fondation ABBL pour l’éducation financière and other partners, young minds from around the world with the aim of fighting poverty with smart technologies.The “Creative Coding for ALL” is an initiative by the Luxembourg Tech School (LTS) to provide all young people living in Luxembourg with equal opportunities to do their first steps in the world of coding, digital thinking and creating in a fun and playful way.
