The Space Resources module aims to enhance interest and awareness of space sciences and technology among high school students. During this module the students obtain general knowledge about space exploration and get the opportunity to work with real robots.

The module has started with an inspiring talk by Dr. Abigail Calzada Diaz, R&T Associate at ESRIC, and continued with series of hands-on sessions about the basics of Space Resources and Robotics technologies.

At the end of the module the students visited the LunaLab of the University of Luxembourg where they per performed different experiments with the robots that were used during the Space Resources module and learned about the inspiring work of the researchers from the SnT-SpaceR research group.
