A unique international collaboration will mark the upcoming two years as LTS has been selected to participate in the 2022-2024 Cohort of the Scratch Education Collaborative (SEC).

Since the launch of the **Creative Coding for ALL** initiative two years ago, LTS aims to extend its commitment to provide equal educational chances to everyone by empowering young people in special situations and with specific needs.

As first organisation from Luxembourg, LTS has now been selected to participate in the prestigious **2022-2024 Cohort of the Scratch Education Collaborative (SEC)** and will join forces with similarly mission-aligned organizations around the world to work on the collective goals making coding accessible to everyone.

Scratch is a free, high-level visual programming language developed by the recognised MIT Media Lab. Being a block-based coding language, it allows for an easier access and introduction to coding and enhances the creative side of the participants. Especially for LTS recent work with young people with special needs, Scratch has proven itself to be indispensable as an educational programming tool.

It is a true recognition of LTS's recent work with young people with special needs and we are looking forward to engaging in this collaborative learning experience and contributing to bridge the digital divide in Luxembourgâ€™s society and worldwide.
