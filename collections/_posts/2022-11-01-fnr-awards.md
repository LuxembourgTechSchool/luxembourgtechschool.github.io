By getting a younger generation excited for science and technology, and by helping them to develop digital skills, the Luxembourg Tech School (LTS) has already helped hundreds of young people to get ready for the world of tomorrow. The LTS team is awarded the 2022 FNR Award for Promotion of Science to the Public.

LTS was founded with the goal of inspiring students aged 12 to 19 to learn and apply technology in a real context.
In other words, to build the future digital leaders that will solve business and societal problems of tomorrow with the help of digital technologies.

Instead of being another coding school, we teach with a purpose, by covering key business areas in Luxembourg, such as Finance, Artificial Intelligence or Space Resources. We teach the same technologies that professionals use. For example, our students learn to work with the same robotics platform that universities use in Master level studies.
Simultaneously, various soft skills are fostered, for example, teamwork, managing a project, or pitching skills. 

All this is only achievable because of team effort, a team composed of LTS coaches, freelancers, school teachers, sponsors and of course the students. In addition, we also have Student Coaches, who can gain their first real job experience with us. The content that the coaches teach is revised every year based on technology evolution, and they are also encouraged to propose new topics. This gives coaches the opportunity to learn and grow themselves. 

LTS is now present in more than 10 schools in the country and is coaching around 200 students per year. 

We always dreamed of bringing this knowledge and skills to all teenagers in Luxembourg, and now it is starting to happen...
