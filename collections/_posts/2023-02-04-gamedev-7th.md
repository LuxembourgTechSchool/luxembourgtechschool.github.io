The 7th Edition of the LTS Game Dev Pitch Competition was a wonderful afternoon filled with gaming, excitement, and lots of fun. Over 80 talented LTS Level One students pitched the video game projects they had been developing over the previous 12 weeks to the public and to industry professionals. Over 190 guests attended the event to see the pitches, interact with the creators, and play their games.

Due to this scale of the event, students pitched their games in a unique format. Teams were split into two pitch groups, from which the best 6 teams were invited onto the big stage to pitch again in front of the entire event.

To complement the student-developed games, racing simulators and VR games had also been set up for the public and students to enjoy during their downtime and to demonstrate what's possible in the world of game dev.

It was a remarkable showcase of creativity and innovation and LTS would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the event's winners:

**Best Fun Game:** Cheat Engine

**Best Educational Game:** Night Driving

**Best Team:** Mystery Motel


Honorable mentions and high fives go out to the teams behind Crashed, PlanIt, CyberRunner, Endless Hell, and Anvil.
