In the digital age, financial security is more important than ever. With an increasing number of people relying on financial technology (FinTech) for everyday transactions, ensuring the safety and security of these applications is a top priority. To address this challenge, a group of Luxembourg Tech Schoolâ€™s Level Up, Level One, and Alumni students came together at the Luxembourg House of Cybersecurity on 21st to 23rd April with the goal of creating innovative and secure financial applications.

After one day of hacking the students got the opportunity to meet with experienced mentors from the finance, technology, and cybersecurity industries who help them to crystallise and finalise their ideas.

On the final day, the students presented their ideas to an esteemed panel of jury, composed of Petra Krizan, Managing Director at The Blockhouse Technology, Pascal Steichen, CEO of the LHC, Charalampia Lagou, Co-Managing Director of Girls In Tech Luxembourg, and Nasir Zubairi, CEO of the LHoFT, who evaluated the projects based on their innovation, implementation, and presentation.

After much deliberation, the jury announced the top three winners:
- Pescathorian
- SafeSignify
- PassPouch
