It's more important than ever to develop strong cybersecurity skills.

In collaboration with LetzPwn, a community of Luxembourgish cybersecurity experts and the first Capture the Flag (CTF) team from Luxembourg, LTS students participated in a cybersecurity workshop on June 17, 2023.

In this event, students learned how to discover and exploit system vulnerabilities to discover and capture digital "flags." 

This type of event helps students become more aware of the strategies that hackers use, the cybersecurity vulnerabilities that exist, and ways to be safer on the internet.
