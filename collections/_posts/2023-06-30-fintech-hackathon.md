From Friday to Sunday, 38 LTS Level One Students worked together to build their vision for the next generation of financial solutions in this year's FinTech Hackathon. Over the course of the weekend, students were tasked with developing a business idea, creating a product prototype, and presenting a pitch to a panel of industry experts and professionals from Luxembourg's innovative Financial Technology sector.

Hosted in the Luxembourg City Incubator and Luxembourg House of Financial Technology, LTS coaches and many mentors were kind to spend their time listening to students and providing valuable feedback to their ideas. At the end of the weekend, despite only having three days to work on these projects, students were able to develop  exciting, innovative, and disruptive solutions to today's financial problems. The panel of judges recognized the top 3 teams for their work:

**3rd Place:** SIMoney & Investor League

**2nd Place:** Money Mentor

**1st Place:** DivideX

LTS would like to thank all of the students, coaches, mentors, and judges who made this weekend a success. Without this community, these events would not be possible.
