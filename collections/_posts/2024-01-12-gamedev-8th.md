This year's 8th annual Game Dev Pitch Competition was another successful instalment of one of LTS's flagship events. This year, Level one students designed, developed, and pitched video game projects to the public and industry professionals. Students spent 12 weeks on these projects and were able to develop some impressive final results.

This year, LTS welcomed [videogames.lu](videogames.lu), who brought some extra fun with their extensive console and video game collection. Through this library, students and the public were able to see what is possible in the world of game dev. 

Overall, it was a remarkable showcase of creativity and innovation and LTS would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the event's winners:

**Best Fun Game:** Zen Sculpt and Wello

**Best Educational Game:** Get Back to Green

**Best Team:** Slash n Dash
