Following up on the success of last year's cybersecurity workshop, LTS collaborated once again with the talented experts at LetzPwn to help students develop important skills in today's digital world.

On March 16th, LTS students participated in a Capture the Flag (CTF) workshop at the LTS lab. The workshop provided students with hands-on experience in cybersecurity and plunged participants into a series of challenges, where they applied their skills in identifying and exploiting system vulnerabilities to capture hidden digital 'flags.'
