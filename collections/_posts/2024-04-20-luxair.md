Students pitched Luxair's judges various ideas on how to integrate AI into their existing services to better serve customers and make air travel easier. The pitches focused on using AI to address one of two challenges: improving the customer experience, or improving Luxair's internal tools.

In the end, the judges decided that Team Rome and Team Geneva pitched innovative proposals that addressed these challenges, and crowned them the event's winners.
