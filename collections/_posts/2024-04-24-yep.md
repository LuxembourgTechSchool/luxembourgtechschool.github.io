In this year's YEP!-Schoulfoire, LTS hosted Luxembourg's school students at an exciting robotics workshop: mBot Mania. The workshop involved using visual programming to code small, remote-controlled robots to play football against each other. Through this activity, students were able to get firsthand experience with robotics and programming, all while having fun.

LTS Coaches Julie Tangeten and Roy Steinmetzer developed the idea, designed the workshop, and even built the pitch. From the smiles on everyone's faces, it's clear they did a great job. Their creativity, imagination, and hard work made all of this possible.
