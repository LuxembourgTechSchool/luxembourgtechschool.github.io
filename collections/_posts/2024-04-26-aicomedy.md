AI is often discussed as a productivity tool, but little is said about its creative applications. This year, LTS Level Up students expressed their creativity by using AI to create standup comedy routines.

On Friday, students and coaches gethered in the House of Startup's Big Bang event center and presented their comedic AI projects. Students took different approaches to get the most out of AI's comedic ability, showcasing their creativity and problem-solving ability.

**Why use AI for creativity?**

LTS is well aware of copyright problems associated with AI.
In our mission to teach every student about the latest technologies and trends, AI is an important tool.
That's why we not only teach about the tools, their limitations and legal frameworks, but also design interesting projects that will challenge them in new ways.
