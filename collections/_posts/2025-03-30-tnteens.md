On April 3, we hosted a coding and robotics workshop at TN'Teens, where students programmed Lego robots to navigate a maze. 

Coding is turning into a core competency across all industries, from science to finance to the creative arts. By introducing kids to technology in a fun, interactive setting, we aim to spark curiosity and build up their confidence in their capability to achieve great things.

At LTS, we believe in making learning enjoyable and engaging. Registrations for our upcoming programs open soon, and we’re excited to offer more hands-on experiences like this one!
