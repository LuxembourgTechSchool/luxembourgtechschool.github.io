After launching a weather balloon into the stratosphere, students from the LTS Space Resources module also experienced what it’s like to walk on the moon. They visited the LunaLab at the University of Luxembourg. The lab is filled with 20,000 kilograms of special gravel that is meant to resemble Moon rock. It's one of the few places in the world where researchers and students can test space robots and systems that might one day be used in real lunar missions.  

Prof. Dr. Miguel Olivares-Mendez, Head of SpaceR group, LunaLab and Zero-G Lab at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), showed students the facilities that can allow them to continue learning about space right here in Luxembourg. Experiences like this give students a glimpse into paths they might not have considered before. The activities within the LTS Space Resources module are meant to spark their curiosity and make them aware of the great things they can achieve. With many space companies based in Luxembourg, it’s important to support students as they take their first steps toward careers in space and planetary science.
