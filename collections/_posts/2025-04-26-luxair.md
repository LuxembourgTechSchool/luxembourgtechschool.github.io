The room felt like an airport before take-off: a bit of nervous energy, and the sense that something important was about to begin. At Luxair’s headquarters, students presented the AI-powered travel solutions they had spent weeks building.

From apps that suggest destinations based on the user’s music taste to tools that help people rediscover cities like Luxembourg, most teams thought of apps suitable for curious and adventurous travellers. Each of the teams built a working prototype by using Python and Streamlit. Each team integrated an LLM in a novel manner to power their apps and create new and interested services.  

At the final event, students showcased their work and received prizes for the most creative and well-developed ideas. Most students went home with a prize, a smile, and the satisfaction of having come up with an idea that can make travelling more interesting–and more than that, they also built their own prototypes.
