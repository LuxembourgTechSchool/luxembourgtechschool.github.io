If you’re between 15 and 19 years old and curious about technology, you can sign up for the second edition of the LTS AI 4 ALL Summer Camp. This is a one-week program that will help you learn how to start your own AI projects.

Each day brings something new. You’ll train a basic AI model, program robots to move and respond to voice commands, and experiment with tools that create images and music. You’ll also explore machine learning in Python and visit real research labs. At the end of the week, you will present your team project during a special event.

No experience is needed—just an open mind and a bit of curiosity. You’ll be supported by experienced coaches, work with other students, and meet experts from the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST), IBM, and LuxProvide. What better way to spend a week of this summer than by learning how AI is shaping our society?
