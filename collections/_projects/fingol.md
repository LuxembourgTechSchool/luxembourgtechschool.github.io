FinGoL is a dynamic educational game in the form of a chatbot developed by LTS students with the help of coaches and financial support by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). It is aimed at a young audience and makes it possible to simulate the financial life of an adult as well as the situations which the latter is confronted with in real life.
