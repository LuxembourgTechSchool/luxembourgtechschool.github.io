FrankensteinAI is an immersive, interactive experience developed by LTS coaches and students and based on a multi-year research project of Columbia University’s Digital Storytelling Lab. It aims to explore the social and ethical implications of how we design and interact with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and what it means to be human in the age of AI. Students of LTS worked on the project as part of the “LTS Learning to Work” program over the course of several months and presented it for the first time in November 2019 at the 20th anniversary event of the Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR). Further performances are planned for the future.
