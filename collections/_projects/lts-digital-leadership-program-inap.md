The LTS Digital Leadership Program focuses on solving problems and creating an impact with sustainable, innovative and creative products or services. 
The first cohort of participants from various administrations of the Luxembourgish Government learnt over the course of three modules («From Ideas to Solutions», «Data for Solving Problems» and «Important Subjects in Digital») how to use different technologies and applications to quickly prototype, continuously iterate and build digital, user-focused solutions. 
In all sessions the focus was on hands-on digital work in small teams and on implementing the ideas and projects of the course participants.
