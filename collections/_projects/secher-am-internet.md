[Sécher am Internet](https://learn-ebanking.fondation-abbl.lu/en) is an information platform and simulator tool that teaches in an inclusive way how to use the internet to manage finances safely and independently. The platform was developed and implemented over the course of 18 months by nine LTS Students with the support of their LTS Coaches.

The project was initiated by an [LTS Fintech Hackathon](https://www.techschool.lu/2021/07/05/fintech-hackathon.html) which took place at the beginning of July 2021. 25 young participants from the Luxembourg Tech School developed exciting ideas to make it easier for the older generation to access the digital world and technical offerings. The winning project CyberLearn convinced the jury with the idea of a learning app about cybersecurity and online banking. 

From this idea and as part of the national training program Ech kann dat och on the subject of online banking, the project Sécher am Internet was born on behalf of the [Fondation ABBL pour l’Education Financière](https://www.abbl.lu/en/consumers/financial-education/abbl-foundation).  

Texts, videos, graphics, and exercises in three languages (EN, DE, FR) were designed, written, programmed and produced by the young LTS Students from January 2022 to July 2023. 

The Sécher am Internet site aims to introduce individuals to online banking through a series of themed chapters on topics such as digital identity, two-factor authentication, mobile payments, and the right reflexes to protect against online fraud. 

The platform is linked to an e-banking services simulator which allows users to put themselves in a real-life situation. The user is guided through the typical actions offered by online banking, such as logging in, checking account balances, or carrying out transactions.
