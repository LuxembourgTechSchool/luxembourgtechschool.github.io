                            LTS has fully adopted the concept of the flipped classroom.
                            This means that during the class, you only work on practical and interactive activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the start of each module, you get access to new online learning material such as videos and tutorials that you can watch anywhere.
                            The first few classes are crash courses where you learn the basics of certain technologies needed to work on your project.
                            After that, you spend the rest of the classes working in teams on your own project.
