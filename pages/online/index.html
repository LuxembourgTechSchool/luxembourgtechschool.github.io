        <p>This new after-school program offers a fun and gamified learning experience for high-school <strong>students
        aged 14 to 18</strong>. <br>
        <strong>During 4 months</strong>, <strong>March to June</strong>, you will learn to <strong>create 3D artworks</strong>. <br>
        From modelling and texturing to lighting and rendering, you’ll gain new creative skills and learn about the
        latest technologies related to digital arts, such as non-fungible token (NFTs).</p>

        <p>Just like the regular LTS curriculum, this program uses a project-based approach. You work on your own ideas,
        projects and in groups.</p>

        <p>Classes are <strong>online</strong>, <strong>100% free</strong> and take place <strong>every Wednesday at 17h00</strong>.</p>

        <p>Additionally, there will be <strong>several in-person events</strong>, called “Creator’s Marathon”, where we all
        meet and create together.
        The program closes with an <strong>epic 2-day Hackathon</strong>.</p>
