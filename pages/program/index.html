        Program
    </h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">
        This epic program is for all 11-19 years old students who are passionate about the digital realm and eager to
        learn and apply
        technology in a real business context.
    </h2>
    <div class="content content--highlighted">
        At the moment, we offer a 3 year program. You can start with Level Go or with Level One, depending on your age.
        Each level is divided into up to 3 modules, each centered on one specific business domain.
        <br>At the end of each course, you (the student) will have the opportunity to present your project to the real
        world!
        <br>
        The program below is a preview of the cool topics that are covered.
        There won't be much theory (a little is always useful).
        It is filled with practical examples, exercices and you work on your own project!
        <br>You will learn a lot about software development, entrepreneurship and even increase your presentation skills
        by multiple factors.
        <br>
        It won't be easy, but at the end you will have created an awesome piece of work, will have learned a ton of
        things and most importantly you will have had a lot of fun.
